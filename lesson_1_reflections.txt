i  hope this is very useful for my future projects.
reflections is a very good topic which is based on our way of pursuing and emotions associated with our experiences.
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
we were able to go through each and every detail which gave us an oppurtunity to understand the mistakes thoroughly.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
easy access helps us in future to understand what were the steps taken previously and how are those modified
we can even retrieve our previous code and mistakes related to it.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros:we can create a logical and clear commit.
cons:we may sometimes miss contents since they have to be manually saved.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because they largely involve coding i think this method of commit is apt and clumpsyness is reduced.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log is used to see all the commits in a respository.
whereas git diff is used to compare and notice the changes in commits.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it made me confident because i could findout my bug and rectify it,if at all i go wrong.
How Do You Want to Use Git?
i want to use git for all my projects in future wich can be of guidance to me.
